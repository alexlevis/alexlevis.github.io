Before this, I completed a PhD in Biostatistics from Harvard University, and obtained a MSc in Biostatistics and BSc in Pharmacology from McGill University. Broadly, I am interested causal inference and missing data, and typically appeal to statistical methods backed by semiparametric efficiency theory. A main purpose of this website is to be a platform for hosting short posts about statistics, math, or other topics. I may add a dedicated research page in the future, but for now feel free to check me out on Google Scholar to see what I’ve worked on.

There is a large literature in economics and epidemiology on this topic, but much of the terminology is scattered, and the underlying causal and statistical frameworks vary from place to place. My goal in this post is to give an overview of the salient features of an instrumental variable (IV), and discuss when (and perhaps how) IVs can be used to aid in causal inference research.
