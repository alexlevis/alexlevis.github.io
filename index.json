[{"categories":null,"content":"A focus of my postdoctoral research is on using instrumental variables for causal inference. There is a large literature in economics and epidemiology on this topic, but much of the terminology is scattered, and the underlying causal and statistical frameworks vary from place to place. My goal in this post is to give an overview of the salient features of an instrumental variable (IV), and discuss when (and perhaps how) IVs can be used to aid in causal inference research.
