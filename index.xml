    <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been listening to (i.e., binging) the <a href="https://casualinfer.libsyn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Casual Inference</a>
podcast hosted by Lucy D&rsquo;Agostino McGowan and Ellie Murrary, and a
question was raised at least a couple of times (Season 3 Episode 10 &amp;
Season 4 Episode 9): does adjusting for an instrument (in, e.g., a
propensity score model) cause bias? I believe the answer to this
question is no, except in somewhat extreme scenarios. However, such a
choice will impact the <em>efficiency</em> of a treatment effect
estimator. In this post, I want to review a pair of lemmas from an
excellent paper by <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume21/19-1026/19-1026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Rotnitzky &amp; Smucler (2020; JMLR)</a> to formally
address this and related issues.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I got stuck on what I thought was a simple point while working through
a stats textbook! I figured it out, I think, but was this the most
straightforward path to understanding?  You tell me! In this note, we
explore some oft-used facts about moment-generating functions, and
explain a connection with tail and concentration inequalities.</p>
<h2 id="overview-and-my-confusion">Overview and my confusion</h2>
<p>I am currently reading through <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Martin Wainwright</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Dimensional-Statistics-Non-Asymptotic-Statistical-Probabilistic-ebook/dp/B07N46XF8B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">High-dimensional
statistics: A non-asymptotic viewpoint</a></em>, to fill some gaps in my stat
theory knowledge. While I&rsquo;m only partway through, I can definitely
already recommend this book for those wanting to get familiar with
some of the modern theoretical machinery needed to validate
statistical methods that we use on difficult problems!</p>]]></description>
